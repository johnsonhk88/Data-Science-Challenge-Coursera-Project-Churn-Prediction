## Two Methods for Churn Prediction Project
1. File "ChurnPrediction.ipynb" use original coursera project environment ,more supported on sklearn library
2. File "ChurnPrediction_johnson.ipynb" use my local computer environment, which support more Machine Learning/Deep Learning methods (Pytorch, MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,  etc), for comparsion the better performance from different algorithms
